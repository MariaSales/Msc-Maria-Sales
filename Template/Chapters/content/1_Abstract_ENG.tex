Models, metamodels and model transformations play a central role in~\gls{mdd}.~\gls{ocl} was initially proposed as part of the~\gls{uml} standard to add the precision and validation capabilities lacking in its diagrams, and also to express well-formedness rules in its metamodel. OCL has found several other applications, such as for defining design metrics, code-generation templates or validation rules for model transformations, required in MDD.

Learning OCL as part of a UML course at the university would, therefore, seem natural, but is still the exception rather than the rule. We believe that is mainly due to a widespread perception that OCL is hard to learn, gleaned from claims made in the literature. Based on data gathered over the past school years from a large number of undergraduate students of different Software Engineering courses, we analyzed how learning design by contract clauses with UML+OCL compares with several other~\gls{swebok} topics. The outcome of the learning process was collected in a rigorous setup, supported by an e-learning platform. We performed inferential statistics on that data to support our conclusions, and to identify the relevant explanatory variables for students success/failure. The obtained findings lead us to extend an existing OCL tool with two novel features: one is aimed at OCL apprentices and goes straight to the heart of the matter, by allowing to visualize how OCL expressions traverse a UML~\gls{classDiagram}; the other is intended for researchers and allows to compute OCL complexity metrics, making it possible to replicate a research study like this one.
